# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Face-Recognition-System
Real-Time Object Detection and Face Recognition system built using YOLOv8, MTCNN, and FaceNet. The project performs live object detection and face recognition through a webcam. It includes a Streamlit-based interactive UI for uploading images, generating face embeddings, and running real-time recognition with a modular, privacy-aware design.
